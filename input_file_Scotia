# Input of general parameters for composite source model
#  mu = rigidity
#  rmin = minimum sub-event radius and is set relative to average element area
#         rmin should be great than 2 (otherwise the smallest subevents might
#         not be represented well on the fault). This is also dependent on how
#         much the cell size on the fault varies.
#  rmax = maximum sub-event radius and is set relative to width of fault
#         rmax must be less than 0.5 (otherwise the sub-events could be larger than the fault width)
#         while 0.5 is an upper limit, often a smaller value maybe be needed as the width is sometimes
#         an approixmation in case where programme is defining slipping area.
#  na = number of asperities to be placed on fault
#  mesh_file = name of file containing unstructured mesh

# Surface parameters

#                  .false =  no file exists and the surface is assumed to occur at z = 0.0
#                            in this case +z values in the mesh are assumed to be above the surface
#                            (i.e. the coniditon for finding the surface is  z >= 0.0 )
