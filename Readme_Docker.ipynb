    "_k223d_ is written in fortran and there needs to be compiled with a fortran compiler. In the case of the docker example we will use gfortran whose libraries are preloaded in the docker environement. To compile the k223d, click on the terminal images in the notebook. And type the following commands:\n",

There are two examples provided: in the folder `planar_eg` the file _planar_mesh.ipynb_ is a workflow on how to produce a planar mesh, run _k223d_ and view the results. In the folder `EFSM_eg` the file _read_EFSM20.ipynb_ provides an example on how to read a mesh from the EFSM database, remesh it, run _k223d_, view the results and generate an file that can be viewed in QGIS. \n",
